CapDL initialiser for seL4
==========================

This repository contains the capDL initialiser for seL4.

The capDL initialiser is the root task for a seL4 system that takes a
description of the state to be initialised using [capDL][capDL paper],
and starts the system in conformance with the specification.

The code is an implementation of the formal algorithm specified
in Isabelle/HOL.

Repository overview
-------------------

  * [`src/main.c`](src/main.c): The implementation of the initialiser
  * [`include/capdl.h`](include/capdl.h): The data structure for capDL.


Dependancies
-------------

The capDL loader uses `capDL-tool` to generate a data structure
containing the capDL specification to be initialised.
